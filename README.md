# Dice-Calcutor-App
First serious and completed project. Developed in android studio with Java. Uses mXparser as an external library for "equals" symbol.

It functions similarly to most calculators out there, the mayor difference being the option add dice rolls to your calculations. Pressing a `dice` button will generate a number in the range of the dice being pressed.

Eg.
7 + d20 + 2 = 11
(7 + 2 + 2 = 11)

In the example above the d20 "roll" is revealed to be a two. In the future there will be an option to hide rolls until the equals button is pressed.

TODO:
- Manage day and night themes.
- Create a "Drama Mode" where dice results are not revealed until the end.
- Add the ability to record calculations in a "history" section.
- (Maybe) Custom themes so each player can have their personalized calculator.

There's a compiled version of this app available in the [releases](https://github.com/DMTumbler/Dice-Calculator/releases) section of the page for those interested in trying it out.
